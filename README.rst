cardboardlint
-------------

Cheap lint solution for PRs.

This is a wrapper for other linters, which only reports messages related to lines that
have changed compared to some other commit, e.g. the head of the branch being merged into.
It is a simple and more customizable alternative to tools like Hound CI, Stickler CI,
Linthub.io, landscape.io etc.

It can be used as follows:

- Add a ``.cardboardlint.yml`` to the root of your source tree. It should at least contain
  a `linters` section with a list of linters, e.g.

  .. code:: yaml

      linters:
      - pylint:
          pylintrc: tools/your_custom_pylintrc
      - cppcheck:
      - import:
      ...

  A list of supported linters is easily deduced from the source code. Just look into
  the ``cardboardlint/linter_*.py`` files. Each of these files has a module docstring with
  some explanations and a DEFAULT_CONFIG dictionary with the available configuration vars.

  You can repeat any linter multiple times with different configuration settings. This can
  be useful, e.g. when unit tests must be linted differently than the rest of the source
  code. This is a simple example where unit tests have a different pylint config:

  .. code:: yaml

      linters:
      - pylint:
          pylintrc: tools/pylintrc
          filefilter: ['- test_*.py', '+ *.py']
          exclude:
      - pylint:
          pylintrc: tools/pylintrc_tests
          filefilter: ['+ test_*.py']
      - import:
      ...

  Each linter has a `filefilter` option, which is a list of rules to test if a file should
  be considered for linting or not. Each rule consists of a result, `+` (include) or a `-`
  (exclude), followed by a glob pattern. If a pattern matches, the result is found and
  further rules are not considered. If no rules apply, the file is excluded.

- Install the linters you intend to run (either locally or in your CI environment). These
  dependencies are not installed automatically because you may not want to use all of
  them.

  We do provide conda packages for linters, when needed in our channel on Anaconda.org:
  https://anaconda.org/theochem. For now, we have only added a package for ``cppcheck``.

- Download and install the latest version from git and run the cardboardlinter.

  - Travis-CI (in ``.travis.yml``). This will only report messages for lines that have
    changed in the PR.

    .. code:: yaml

        install:
        # Install the latest cardboardlinter
        - if [ "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" != "false" ]; then
            pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/theochem/cardboardlint.git@master#egg=cardboardlint;
          fi

        script:
        # Run the cardboardlinter, in case of pull requests
        - if [ "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" != "false" ]; then
            cardboardlinter --refspec $TRAVIS_BRANCH;
          fi

  - Local machine (without venv). This checks all of the code, not just lines that have
    changed.

    .. code:: bash

        pip install --upgrade --user git+https://github.com/theochem/cardboardlint.git@master#egg=cardboardlint
        cardboardlinter
